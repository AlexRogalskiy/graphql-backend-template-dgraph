# GraphQL Editor Team - Dgraph Backend template

This template is worth 2020 âœ¨.

Brought by [GraphQL Editor Team](https://graphqleditor.com)

## Why?

You get database with graphql interface for storing your data just from GraphQL Schema. 

## How it works

Like that, and it is only from GraphQL Schema!! :

## Quick Start

```sh
npm run install
```

To start with this template you will need GraphQL Schema. Create one with [GraphQL Editor](https://app.graphqleditor.com) and copy its contents to `schema.graphql` file. Or if you are super lazy take one from `example-schema.graphql` and copy its contents to `schema.graphql` Remember when using Dgraph you need only Types, Interfaces and Enums. Also there is a small bug in Dgraph which doesnt allow comments in schema files.

Example schema can look like this [Schema](https://app.graphqleditor.com/dgraph-testing/finance)

Run this command in one terminal

```
npm run dgraph
```

And run this command in the other one

```
npm run inject-dgraph-schema
```

Voila. Your GraphQL native database is ready to use. Run queries in a tool like [Firecamp](https://firecamp.app), so Insomnia, GraphiQL etc.

## Generate Client libraries

When the server is running you can generate the actual dgraph generated schema file and autcomplete library for Javascript or TypeScript Frontend

### Browser / React Native

#### TypeScript
```
npm run generate-nodets
```

#### Javascript
```
npm run generate-nodejs
```
